# Graduate-Admit-Predict-and-Analysis

## Introduction

Millions of Indians dream of studying in some of the top universities of the world but what is the procedure of getting into them? How do they take in students and what do they expect from them? Here, I have done some analysis on the dataset provided by [Mohan S Acharya](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya)  from Kaggle. My attempt is to explain the neccesary features required to boost your chances for getting an admit. The details regrading the dataset is given below.
